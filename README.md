# Hi, I’m Jimmy 👋

Product leader building AI systems to learn, validate product decisions, and move from zero to one.  
Product background, builder by necessity. I build to make ideas tangible.

## What I work on 🔧
- AI agents and applied AI systems  
- Prototypes and proofs of concept  
- UIs and building blocks others can extend

## What this profile is 📌
Non-commercial work, experiments, and patterns I’ve built for myself and teams.  
Pinned repos are intentional. They reflect product thinking through building.

## A belief I build by 💡
Most people overestimate how much technology is required and the outcomes it will deliver, and underestimate the human perspective.  
I aim to build human-centered products with just enough technology.

## About me 🚀
I work in consulting as a product manager, leading enterprise AI initiatives and building LINKIT’s business in the US.

My focus is on turning enterprise AI from strategy into working systems: defining the right problems, designing human-centered solutions, and building just enough technology to validate decisions and scale what works. I use GitHub to explore ideas, prototype AI agents, and pressure-test product thinking through code.
