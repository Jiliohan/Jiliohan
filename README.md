# Hi, I’m Jimmy 👋

Product leader building AI systems to learn, validate product decisions, and move from zero to one.  
Product background, builder by necessity.

## What I work on 🔧
- Enterprise AI agents and applied AI systems  
- Prototypes, proofs of concept, and UIs others can build on

## About me 🚀
I work in consulting as a product manager, leading enterprise AI initiatives and helping build LINKIT’s business in the US.

I use GitHub to explore ideas, prototype AI agents, and pressure-test product thinking through code.

Most people overestimate how much technology is required and underestimate the human perspective. I aim to build human-centered products with just enough technology.
