# 👋 Hi, I’m Jimmy

I’m a product leader who builds AI systems to learn, validate decisions, and move faster.

My background is in product, not engineering, but building has become the most effective way for me to explore ideas, test assumptions, and make trade-offs tangible. Increasingly, it’s faster to build something real than to explain it.

## 🧭 Why this GitHub exists

This is where I work in public on non-commercial projects:

- AI agents and applied AI workflows  
- Prototypes and proofs of concept  
- UIs and foundations others can build on  

I use this space to go from zero to one, learn by doing, and pressure-test product ideas before they turn into strategy or scale.

Most projects start small. Some stay small on purpose.

## 🔧 How I build

I build to learn.  
I build to validate product decisions.  
And I build because it’s now often faster than explaining.

The goal is not perfect code or a fashionable stack. The goal is to understand:
- what actually matters to users  
- where complexity helps and where it hurts  
- what “just enough technology” looks like in practice  

---

## 🚀 What I’m focused on

- Human-centered AI systems  
- Practical agent setups that do real work  
- Lightweight tooling that removes friction rather than adding it  
- Exploring how far you can get with less technology than people assume  

Automation shows up naturally in most projects, but it’s rarely the starting point.

## 📌 How to read this profile

Pinned repositories are intentional. They highlight:
- End-to-end product thinking, not isolated experiments  
- Clear problem framing and trade-offs  
- Work that was built to be used, not just demonstrated  

Each README is treated like a product artifact: what it does, why it exists, how to try it, and what I learned building it.

## 💡 A belief I build by

Most people overestimate how much technology is required and the outcomes it will deliver.  
They underestimate the human perspective when building products.

I try to build human-centered products with just enough technology to make them work.
